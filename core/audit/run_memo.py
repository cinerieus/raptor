"""Bounded, thread-safe memo for repeated mechanical tool sweeps.

Several /audit backends produce output that is a pure function of
inputs far coarser than one hypothesis: a CodeQL ``database analyze``
evaluates a query over the WHOLE database regardless of which
function the hypothesis names, and a compiler-analyzer pass emits
every diagnostic for the WHOLE translation unit. Running those
backends once per hypothesis re-pays the full cost for byte-identical
results. This memo collapses the repeats: the first caller with a
given key executes, everyone else reuses the parsed result.

Scope and safety:

* Values are parsed RESULTS held in-process. Execution on a miss
  still goes through the caller's compute callable — including its
  sandbox — unchanged; the memo never provides an unsandboxed path.
* Keys must embed content stamps (file hashes, tool identity) so a
  process outliving one run cannot serve stale results; a caller that
  cannot build a trustworthy key passes ``key=None`` and always
  executes.
* Exceptions from ``compute`` propagate and cache nothing — a failed
  execution is never replayed as a result.
* Concurrent callers of the SAME key are collapsed onto one
  execution via a per-key lock; distinct keys never block each other.
