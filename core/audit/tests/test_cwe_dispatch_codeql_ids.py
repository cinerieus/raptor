"""Pin the dispatch table's CodeQL query IDs to reality.

Every ``codeql`` entry in CWE_TO_TOOL_DISPATCH must either resolve
against an installed pack's ``@id`` index or be dropped by the
loud-once unsupported-query path (the chain slot stays honestly empty
— never a phantom dispatch, never a silent per-dispatch skip storm).

Hermetic tests stub the resolver's per-process pack index; the
opportunistic test checks the REAL installed packs and skips per
language when that pack is absent (CI installs none).
