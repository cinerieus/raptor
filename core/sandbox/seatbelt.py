"""SBPL (Sandbox Profile Language) profile generation for macOS.

Apple's `sandbox-exec(1)` consumes SBPL profiles to enforce file /
network / IPC restrictions at the kernel boundary via the Sandbox
kext + TrustedBSD MAC. This module generates SBPL profile strings
from the same logical kwargs that drive the Linux Landlock + seccomp
+ namespace setup, so callers see one uniform sandbox API regardless
of host OS.

Design decisions, derived from Phase 0 spike (see
``scripts/macos_sandbox_spike.py``):

1. **`(allow default)` baseline + targeted denies.** Pure
   `(deny default)` profiles SIGABRT modern macOS binaries before
   dyld can load libSystem (spike result rc=-6 / SIGABRT). The
   community SBPL idiom — and the only one we can rely on without
   reverse-engineering Apple's `system.sb` — is allow-default with
   explicit denies layered on top. Inverse of Linux Landlock's
   deny-default model, but produces the same operator-visible
   semantics: writes restricted to specific paths, network blocked,
   etc.

2. **`os.path.realpath()` mandatory before SBPL emission.** macOS has
   pervasive symlinks (`/var → /private/var`, `/tmp → /private/tmp`,
   `/etc → /private/etc`). SBPL `(subpath ...)` matches against the
   canonical resolved path; passing the symlink path silently fails
   to match. Spike confirmed: `(deny X (require-not (subpath Y)))`
   denies even legitimate writes when Y is a /var/folders/... path
   that resolves to /private/var/folders/...

3. **`(deny X (require-not (subpath Y)))` is the deny-with-exception
   idiom.** Plain ordering (`(deny X)(allow X subpath)`) doesn't work
   — explicit deny outranks subsequent allow regardless of order.
   The `require-not` clause is the canonical SBPL way to express
   "deny X except where Y matches".

4. **Audit mode = `(allow X (with report))`.** When `--audit` is
   engaged, the file-write deny is replaced (not augmented) with an
   allow + report modifier. The write succeeds AND a kernel sandbox
   log entry is emitted. Captured live via `log stream` filtered on
   `senderImagePath == "/System/Library/Extensions/Sandbox.kext/..."`
   (see seatbelt_audit.py).

5. **Egress proxy port allowed inline.** When use_egress_proxy=True
   the parent sets HTTPS_PROXY=localhost:<port> in the child env;
   the SBPL profile must permit `network-outbound` to that loopback
   port even though network is otherwise denied.

Architectural correspondence:

    Linux Landlock                  → macOS SBPL
    ─────────────────────────────   ─────────────────────────────────
    writable_paths (Landlock allow) → (deny file-write* (require-not
                                       (subpath REALPATH(...))))
    block_network (network-ns)      → (deny network*)
    allowed_tcp_ports               → (allow network-outbound
                                       (remote tcp "*:PORT"))
    seccomp blocklist               → (deny mach-lookup),
                                      (deny iokit-open), etc.
    audit_mode (SCMP_ACT_TRACE)     → (allow file-write* (with report))

    The kwarg surface mirrors core.sandbox.context.sandbox()'s contract.
    Output is a multi-line SBPL source ready for ``sandbox-exec -p``.

    Args:
      target: read-only bind-mount on Linux; on macOS just an
        engagement marker (writes are restricted via the deny clauses,
        reads are always-allowed by the (allow default) baseline).
      output: writable scratch dir. Realpath'd and added to the
        write-allowlist exception clause.
      block_network: emit (deny network*).
      allowed_tcp_ports: emit (allow network-outbound (remote tcp ...))
        for each port. A port equal to proxy_port (the egress-proxy
        lane, folded into this list by the context layer) is skipped:
        the loopback-scoped proxy rules already cover it, and a
        wildcard would open the lane port to every remote address.
      use_egress_proxy: shorthand — implies block_network=True except
        for proxy_port. Caller passes the actual proxy_port number.
      proxy_port: loopback port the egress proxy listens on. Required
        when use_egress_proxy=True.
      restrict_reads: when True, layer a (deny file-read*) with an
        exception clause for system dirs + readable_paths. When False
        (default), reads are unrestricted (matches Linux Landlock
        default).
      readable_paths: extra dirs to allow under restrict_reads=True.
      writable_paths: extra dirs to add to the write-allowlist
        exception (in addition to output).
      fake_home: env-level concern — set HOME to {output}/.home/
        before exec. The profile itself doesn't reference HOME so this
        kwarg is here for signature parity; the actual env mutation
        happens in _macos_spawn.py.
      exclude_tmp_baseline: when True, drop the /private/tmp seed from
        the write-allowlist exception so every /tmp spelling is denied
        (mirrors Linux's writable_paths=[] semantics); the spawn layer
        then redirects the child's TMPDIR into {output}/.tmp.
      audit_mode: when True, replace file-write denies with
        (allow file-write* (with report)) — the write succeeds AND
        emits a kernel sandbox log entry that seatbelt_audit captures.
      audit_verbose: when True (audit_mode must also be True),
        emit `(allow X (with report))` for an extended set of SBPL
        action categories: file-read-data, file-read-metadata,
        mach-lookup, process-exec*, process-fork, process-info*,
        signal, iokit-open, sysctl-read. Closest macOS analogue to
        Linux's SCMP_ACT_TRACE-everywhere strace-style audit.
        Volume protection: seatbelt_audit.LogStreamer routes every
        parsed record through core.sandbox.audit_budget.AuditBudget
        (token-bucket + per-category caps from
        DEFAULT_CATEGORY_CAPS + per-PID cap + 1-in-N sampling for
        high-volume categories from DEFAULT_SAMPLING_RATES). High-
        volume categories like
        file-read-metadata and process-info-* are allowed but
        their JSONL contribution is bounded; operators see a
        `budget_exceeded` marker per category once a cap is hit
        and an `audit_summary` record at stop-time. SBPL is
        coarser than seccomp: records are action-category +
        path/target rather than per-syscall + argv.
      audit_evidence_dir: the run's sandbox-evidence directory
        (``<run_dir>/.audit`` — see core/sandbox/evidence.py). When
        set, an unconditional ``(deny file-write* (subpath ...))``
        clause is emitted for it. SBPL evaluation makes an explicit
        deny outrank allows regardless of clause order (module
        docstring point 3), so the target cannot append to /
        truncate / replace the denial/observe JSONL even in audit
        mode where writes are otherwise allow-with-report. This is
        the macOS expression of the same exclusion the Linux
        backends implement via the mount-ns shadow tmpfs.
      seccomp_profile: name of the requested Linux seccomp profile
        ("full"/"debug"/"network-only"/"none"/None). macOS has no
        direct seccomp equivalent, but "full" (which the full, strict
        and target_run sandbox profiles all map to) engages the SBPL
        hardening set — the macOS expression of the same policy
        intent, "block introspection / IPC / capability-escape
        vectors that don't break common tools":
          * (deny process-info* (target others))
          * (deny iokit-open)
          * (deny signal (target others))
          * (deny nvram*)
          * mach-lookup allowlist-deny (MACOS_BASE_MACH_SERVICES)
          * sysctl-read allowlist-deny (MACOS_SYSCTL_READ_*)
          * POSIX-shm read/write + SysV IPC denies
          * (deny darwin-notification-post)
          * (deny appleevent-send)
          * (deny user-preference-write)
        Every deny is either toolchain-battery-validated
        (2026-08-15: clang, make, git, python, venv, tar) or an
        allowlist-deny whose miss surfaces the missing name in the
        kernel's violation log (see the allowlist constants'
        commentary). "debug" stays permissive by intent (lldb /
        sample / dtrace need the introspection surface); "none"/None
        add nothing.
      profile_name: name of the requested sandbox profile. The
        hardening above made "strict" and "full" identical at the
        SBPL layer (strict historically layered the signal / nvram /
        mach-lookup denies the old full profile left out; they are
        baseline now). "strict" still layers those extras for
        non-"full" seccomp combinations, preserving its historical
        floor. Other values add nothing.

    #     null" — its address detection gets EPERM where a Linux netns
    #     returns ENETUNREACH, and only the latter is handled). JVM

    # below for the proxy port, available for future per-socket
    # allowlists.
