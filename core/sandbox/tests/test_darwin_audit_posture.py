"""Posture honesty for seatbelt audit runs: stamp what is enforced.

Audit mode converts the SBPL read deny into ``(allow file-read* (with
report))`` — observe, don't block — so a darwin ``restrict_reads=True``
audit run has NO read wall: an audited hostile child can read the
telemetry-MAC key and mint tokens. The posture record and
``sandbox_info`` previously stamped the REQUESTED value, so triage
trusted token-verified telemetry exactly on the runs where the target
could mint it. Both stamps now carry the enforced truth (with an
explicit ``read_enforcement: observe-only`` marker at the context
layer), and weakest-wins merging does the rest. Linux is untouched:
its audit tier keeps Landlock enforcing, so the requested value stays
honest there.
