"""RLIMIT_NPROC on the macOS seatbelt lane: relative ceiling, not an
absolute cap.

macOS counts RLIMIT_NPROC against the user's TOTAL simultaneous
processes, so an absolute cap equal to the configured budget sits
BELOW current usage on any busy host and makes every fork inside the
sandbox fail EAGAIN (and admits budget-minus-count forks on a quiet
one). The spawn layer now mirrors the Linux no-namespace lane:
ceiling = current same-UID process count + budget, clamped to the
hard limit; when ps cannot produce a count the cap is skipped with a
warning (Linux /proc-unreadable parity).

One more darwin quirk, confirmed on a real macOS runner: setrlimit
silently stores at most kern.maxprocperuid for RLIMIT_NPROC whatever
value is requested (even under an infinite hard limit), so the spawn
layer requests min(count + budget, kernel clamp) and these tests
compute their expectations with the same clamp — via the real sysctl
helper on macOS, and via a monkeypatched clamp for the emulated
darwin-shape cases on Linux (where the helper is platform-gated to
None).

Emulation stacks on reality: monkeypatching the production sysctl
helper fakes what production REQUESTS, but the actual setrlimit
syscall still hits the actual kernel — on a real darwin host the real
kern.maxprocperuid clamp applies underneath any emulated value (a
fake clamp above the ceiling cannot stop the real kernel storing
less). Every expectation therefore carries the REAL clamp (captured
at import, before any monkeypatch) as an unconditional floor, and the
anti-mask test picks its fake values relative to the real clamp on
darwin so the observed number is the true count+budget.

Cross-platform: SANDBOX_EXEC is swapped for a pass-through script so
the REAL shim + trampoline apply the preexec on Linux too; the count
is monkeypatched to a deterministic value well above any plausible
live usage so lowering the soft limit never breaks the test's own
process tree.
