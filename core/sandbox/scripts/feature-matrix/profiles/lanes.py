"""Lane definitions: docker security options + intended feature shape.

Single source of truth, consumed two ways:
  * run-matrix.sh:   python3 profiles/lanes.py args <lane> --profiles DIR
                     -> newline-separated docker run arguments
  * bin/report.py:   imports LANES and compares each lane's probed
                     shape against the two expectation tiers:
                       expect      — features the lane's own
                                     configuration FORCES (seccomp
                                     fakes, denials) plus the harness's
                                     host floor. A mismatch means the
                                     lane didn't apply -> the cell is
                                     SHAPE-DIVERGED and the run fails.
                       expect_env  — environment-conditioned features
                                     with their NOMINAL values. A
                                     mismatch is a real host shape, not
                                     a harness bug: the cell
                                     self-classifies as
                                     degraded(<features>) and the run
                                     does NOT fail on shape (test
                                     failures still gate). GitHub
                                     runners land here: Ubuntu's
                                     apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns
                                     leaves userns creation working but
                                     denies mount capability inside, so
                                     the full lane probes
                                     UNS=ok MNT=fail — previously
                                     stamped "as-intended" by a
                                     host-conditioned expectation,
                                     burying the divergence the table
                                     itself printed.
                     expect=None with no expect_env = record-only lane
                     ("probe, don't assume").

Design notes
------------
All custom-profile lanes share apparmor=unconfined + CAP_SYS_ADMIN +
root-entry /proc unmasking so that exactly ONE variable — the seccomp
profile — differs between them. Rationale:

  * apparmor=unconfined: Ubuntu's docker-default AppArmor profile denies
    mount(2) even inside a fully-owned user namespace, which would fuse
    the mount/procfs probe results across lanes and mask the seccomp
    variable under test.
  * --user root + SXV_UNMASK=1 (see bin/entry.sh): docker's masked
    /proc paths make procfs "not fully visible", so the kernel refuses
    fresh `mount -t proc` inside a user namespace regardless of
    permissions. The local engine rejects `systempaths=unmasked`
    (verified empirically), so the entry shim unmounts the masks as
    container-root and drops to the runner user. Restores the
    bare-metal runner shape the lanes are modelling.
  * CAP_SYS_ADMIN: the moby default profile only installs its
    unshare/clone/clone3 allow group when the container has
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN in its bounding set (the cap gates which *rules* are
    compiled in, not per-process privilege); it also legalises the
    unmask step. Tests still run as the unprivileged uid-1001 runner
    user, which holds no capabilities.

`default` is stock docker confinement — no overrides, no expectations;
the probe records what it actually blocks.
