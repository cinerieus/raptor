"""HMAC provenance for sandbox telemetry consumed by triage.

The triage classifier's inputs live inside the run output directory —
a tree the sandboxed TARGET holds Landlock write access to while it
runs. ``proxy-events.jsonl`` is appended by the parent between spawns,
so a hostile target can append forged lines, truncate it, or pre-plant
a whole file (including a ``sandbox-summary.json`` for runs where the
real summariser never writes one because there were no denials). The
denials stream itself is already covered by the evidence-fd machinery
(core/sandbox/evidence.py); this module covers the artifacts that are
not.

Writers stamp each artifact with an HMAC-SHA256 token over the exact
fields triage acts on; triage verifies and demotes records that fail.
Key-handling discipline follows core/sage/rowmac.py's fd-fstat reads,
with one deliberate divergence: an on-disk key whose STATE no honest
writer produces (group/other permission bits, a planted symlink, a
non-regular file, over-length content) is treated as TAMPER — the
object is quarantined beside the key (evidence preserved), a tamper
marker is appended (see ``tamper_marker_path``), and a fresh key is
created. Refusing forever instead — the rowmac behaviour — turned a
same-uid ``chmod g+r`` (cheap from any lane whose DAC reaches the
key; Landlock has no metadata rights) into a persistent integrity
DoS: ``key_usable()`` stayed False and triage accepted telemetry at
legacy confidence for every future run. Post-quarantine, tokens
minted under the old key FAIL verification, so triage fails toward
tampering — the honest verdict. Foreign-owned or unreadable keys stay
refused (unattributable; never recovered over another principal's
object), and verification failure remains a demote path, never an
error.

POSTURE DEPENDENCY — what a verifying token actually proves. The key
lives outside the run output directory (the tree the target holds
WRITE access to), but it is NOT outside every sandbox-readable tree:
only a mount namespace (pivoted rootfs) or a read allowlist
(``restrict_reads``) hides it from the child. On read-unrestricted
postures — the Landlock-only default of the ``full`` / ``target_run``
profiles, and macOS runs without ``restrict_reads`` — a hostile
target can read the key and mint valid tokens for forged telemetry.
The spawn layer records each run's posture via
``core.sandbox.summary.record_run_posture``; triage demotes
token-verified telemetry to legacy confidence when the posture could
not have hidden the key. A verifying token therefore means "written
by a key-holder" — only under a key-hiding posture does that narrow
to "written by the parent".

Key
    ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/raptor/telemetry-mac.key`` (default
    ``~/.local/share/raptor/telemetry-mac.key``). Deliberately a
    SEPARATE key from rowmac's: per-purpose keys keep reset/rotation
    semantics scoped — deleting the SAGE key is SAGE's documented
    reset and must not also invalidate sandbox telemetry provenance,
    and vice versa. No rotation: deleting the key makes existing
    tokens fail verification (legacy-demote), and new runs re-key
    lazily.

Every ``fields`` mapping MUST carry a ``kind`` entry naming the
artifact class (``proxy-event``, ``sandbox-summary``) — domain
separation so a token minted for one artifact class can never verify
as another.

    the summary cannot strip the flags without breaking the token.
