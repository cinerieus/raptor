    ``clone_repository`` / ``fetch_commit`` resolve their egress
    allowlist through ``proxy_hosts_for_git()``, which reads the REAL
    ``~/.config/raptor/git-proxy-hosts.json``. On a host where the
    operator has an override configured (documented use: private
    mirrors that ban the public forges) every test asserting the
    static default hosts would fail — env-dependent without gating.
    Redirect the config path so tests always see "no override" unless
    they write one themselves (test_proxy_hosts.py re-patches with its
    own fixture, which layers cleanly on top of this one).
